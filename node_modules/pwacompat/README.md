[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat)

PWACompat is a library that brings the [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/) to non-compliant browsers for better [Progressive Web Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps).
This includes creating splash screens for Mobile Safari, and supporting IE/Edge's Pinned Sites feature.

So, if you've created a `manifest.webmanifest` but want to have wide support everywhere elseâ€”through legacy HTML tags for icons and themingâ€”look no further.
Just include the minified script `pwacompat.min.js` (or [bundle/serve it yourself](https://npmjs.com/package/pwacompat)) in your page:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest" />
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pwacompat@2.0.9/pwacompat.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-VcI6S+HIsE80FVM1jgbd6WDFhzKYA0PecD/LcIyMQpT4fMJdijBh0I7Iblaacawc"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

And you're done! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“„

# Best Practice &amp; Caveats

While PWACompat can generate most icons, meta tags etc that your PWA might need, it's best practice to include at least one `<link rel="icon" ... />`.
This is standardized and older browsers, along with search engines, may use it from your page to display an icon.
For example:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest" />
<script async src="path/to/pwacompat.min.js"></script>
<!-- include icon also from manifest -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="res/icon-128.png" sizes="128x128" />
```

If you're looking for the best load performance, you can also defer loading PWACompat until after your site has loaded.
This is the approach taken in [Emojityper](https://github.com/emojityper/emojityper/blob/master/src/loader.js#L8).

## iOS

PWACompat looks for a viewport tag which includes `viewport-fit=cover`, such as `<meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover">`.
If this tag is detected, PWACompat will generate a meta tag that makes your PWA load in fullscreen modeâ€”this is particularly useful for devices with a notch.

### Old Versions

Prior [to iOS 12.2](https://twitter.com/mhartington/status/1089293403089784832), Mobile Safari opens external sites in the regular browser, meaning that flows like Oauth won't complete correctly.
This [isn't a problem with PWACompat](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat/issues/15), but is an issue with PWAs on iOS generally.

Prior to [iOS 11.3](https://medium.com/@firt/pwas-are-coming-to-ios-11-3-cupertino-we-have-a-problem-2ff49fd7d6ea), Mobile Safari would not respect the `start_url` paramater inside the manifest.
If you want to emulate this behavior (and redirect the user to the start page), then you could detect `navigator.standalone` (indicating that your site is loaded in PWA mode) and set a flag in `window.sessionStorage`.
If the flag is not yet set, then you should redirect to your site's start URL.

## Session Storage

PWACompat uses `window.sessionStorage` to cache your site's manifest (and on iOS, any updated icons and generated splash screens).
This expires after a user navigates away from your page or closes their tab.

# Details

What does PWACompat actually do?
If you provide a Web App Manifest, PWACompat will update your page and:

* Create meta icon tags for all icons in the manifest (e.g., for a favicon, older browsers)
* Create fallback meta tags for various browsers (e.g., iOS, WebKit/Chromium forks etc) describing how a PWA should open
* Sets [the theme color](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android) based on the manifest

For Safari, PWACompat also:

* Sets `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` (opening without a browser chrome) for display modes `standalone`, `fullscreen` or `minimal-ui`
* Creates `apple-touch-icon` images, adding the manifest background to transparent icons: otherwise, iOS renders transparency as black
* Creates dynamic splash images, closely matching the splash images generated [for Chromium-based browsers](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/webapps/WebappSplashScreenController.java?type=cs&q=webappsplash&sq=package:chromium&g=0&l=70)

For IE and Edge:

* Adds meta tags for the [Pinned Sites](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jennifer/2011/04/20/ie-pinned-sites-part-1-what-are-pinned-sites/) feature

For PWAs on Windows with access to UWP APIs:

* Sets the titlebar color

Do you think PWACompat should support backfilling more HTML tags needed for older browsers?
[Let us know!](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat/issues)

## Demo

For a demo, try adding [Emojityper](https://emojityper.com/) or [the demo site](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/pwacompat/test/) to an iOS home screen (to see splash screens and icons).
You can also install Emojityper from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/emojityper/9np2xx3sxmct) (where the titlebar color is automatically set the manifest's `theme_color`).

## Support

This is supported in most modern browsers (UC Browser, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE10+), and fails silenty when unsupported.
Mobile Safari benefits the most from PWACompat, as generating [a large number of splash screens](https://google.com/search?q=ios%20webapp%20splash%20screens) manually is a complex task.

# Web App Manifest

Your Web App Manifest is:

* normally named `manifest.webmanifest` (although some folks name it `manifest.json`)
* referenced from all pages on your site like `<link rel="manifest" href="path/to/manifest.webmanifest" />`
* and should look a bit like this:

```js
{
  "name": "Always Be Progressive",
  "short_name": "Progressive!",
  "display": "browser",
  "start_url": "/",
  "background_color": "#102a48",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "res/icon-256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256"
    },
    {
      "src": "res/icon-128.png",
      "sizes": "128x128"
    }
  ]
}
```
